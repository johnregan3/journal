<p>In this passage, John the Baptist answers the questions of the priests and Levites sent by the Pharisees in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>In v19, Iâ€™m not sure if the first phrase, â€œAnd this is the testimony of John,â€ is the start of this passage or the end of the previous one (basically, that the Word became flesh, and he has been made known to us).</p>

<p>Note the use of the word â€œtestimonyâ€ and â€œconfessâ€ here.  There is a difference between these words.  â€œTestimonyâ€ (Î¼Î±ÏÏ„Ï…ÏÎ¯Î±) is a judicial term, as in â€œthis is the <em>record</em> of Johnâ€¦â€  Compare this with â€œconfessâ€ (á½Î¼Î¿Î»Î¿Î³Î­Ï‰): â€œto assent, to acknowledge, to profess.â€  In English these appear to be similar words, but in the Greek there is a significant difference.</p>

<p>To go back to â€œAnd this is the testimony of John,â€ this use of testimony here indicates that this does, in fact, belong in this passage and not the previous one.  â€œThis is the record of John:â€¦â€ I think would be a good way to render it.</p>

<p>Note Johnâ€™s emphasis on John the Baptist not being the Light.  John writes, â€œHe confessed, and did not deny, but confessed: I am not the Christ.â€  Meaning, he did not deny that he was not the Christ (double negative).</p>

<h3 id="a-prophet">A Prophet</h3>

<p>The priests and Levites then ask him if he is one of two people:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Elijah</em> - Elijah was prophesied to come before the Day of the Lord in Malachai 4:5:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>"Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and awesome day of the LORD comes."</blockquote>

<p>This is interesting, as it is one of the last things God spoke in the Old Testament.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>The Prophet</em> - A reference to the Prophet prophesied by Moses in Deuteronomy 18:15.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>"The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you... And I will put my words in his mouth and he shall speakj to them all that I command him."</blockquote>

<p>These ideas were still circulating during Jesusâ€™s ministry.  At <em>Peterâ€™s Confession of the Christ</em> (Mt 16:13 ff), the disciples respond with, â€œSome say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and other Jeremiah or one of the prophets.â€</p>

<p>The priests &amp; Levites want to determine if heâ€™s one of those sent to speak for God, another prophet.  It had been 400 years since God had spoken to his people.</p>

<p>This points to the power of John the Baptistâ€™s ministry.  He was attracting enough attention and spoke with enough authority that it was worth the time of the Pharisees to question him.</p>

<p>I like v22: â€œWho are you? We need to give an answer to those who sent us?â€ They knew they couldnâ€™t return to their bosses without some kind of answer.</p>

<p>Johnâ€™s response is to point them to another figure from prophecy: The voice crying out in the wilderness (Is 40:3).</p>
