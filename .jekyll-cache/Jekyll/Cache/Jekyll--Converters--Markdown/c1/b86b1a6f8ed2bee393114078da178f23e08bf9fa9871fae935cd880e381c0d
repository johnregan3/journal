I"=<p>This passage is a transition between Jesus’ interactions at the Temple and his conversation with Nicodemus.  Both of these events point to people believing in His <em>signs</em> yet do not truly believe.</p>

<p>There are two observations we can pull from this passage:</p>

<h3 id="1-jesus-is-omniscient">1. Jesus is Omniscient</h3>

<p>Jesus knows what is inside each of us.  And, in particular here, he knows the darkness in us, he knows that we are not trustworthy.</p>

<p>But note that he still walked among us. In fact, he knew what was in Judas all along, yet still continued on His mission.</p>

<h3 id="2-there-is-a-belief-that-cannot-save">2. There is a Belief that Cannot Save</h3>

<p>John says the purpose of his gospel is “…that you may <em>believe</em> that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.” (20:31)  He is writing so that we may believe, that we have true, saving faith.  In fact, even 1 John is an epistle about how to know if we are saved.  His writings are focused on ensuring we believe, and that we believe rightly.</p>

<p>In John 2:23, many people in Jerusalem believed when they saw the signs that Jesus was doing. This is a reflection of the previous passage where the Pharisees demand a sign.  In fact, even the wedding at Cana was a sign.  (Note that both “believed” in v23 and “entrust” in v24 are the same verb in the Greek)</p>

<p>These people were believing because they saw the acts of Jesus, not because of who Jesus is.</p>

<p>In fact, I think there is a difference between believing what you see and true trust. True πιστεύω is grounded in worship, and that worship is expressed through works (and, by extension, obedience).  I can believe lots of things, but unless I am moved to rearrange my life around them, I don’t really, in a biblical sense, believe.</p>

<p>For example, I have salesmen come to my door and have some pretty impressive services to offer.  I believe that getting my yard sprayed for grubworms would make my lawn greener and healthier – these people aren’t lying.  However, unless I’m willing to sign up to become a customer, I don’t really (again, in a biblical sense) believe.</p>

<p>Another example is a test used in marketing: a person may say they like your product, but the true test of if your product has impressed them is if they are willing to actually buy it.  If they won’t buy it, then they really don’t think all that much of it.</p>

<p>So, it’s possible to believe in Jesus and not really believe in Jesus.  There is a kind of belief (or faith) that will not save us.  <em>Not all faith is saving faith.</em></p>

<p>As stated earlier, this is a transitional passage, taking us from the events at the Temple to the secret meeting with Nicodemus.  Nicodemus saw Jesus’ signs and was very interested in finding out more about who Jesus was: “Rabbi, we know tha tyou are a teacher come from God, for no one can <em>do these signs</em> that you do unless God is with him.” (Jn 3:2)</p>

<p>I think of people I know that consider themselves Christian people but it’s clear they aren’t true believers.  They genuinely think Jesus is the only God, they find comfort in a Christian funeral, and can even quote some pieces of Scripture.  However, it’s obvious to me that they don’t really believe because the only time they “are Christians” is during those funerals or a wedding.</p>

<p>As much as I love these people, and as much as they think they are Christians, they simply are not.  They are attracted to the idea of Jesus. They believe He is God. They belive in his miracles.  They believe in His healing power.  They even believe He died for them, but that is all they believe.  They have this sort of logical trust in His <em>signs</em>, but not in Him personally.  He is not their king, they do not worship Him, and they really don’t concern themselves much with obeying him.  (At most, they might worry about not sinning, but nothing about following His will for their lives.)</p>

<h3 id="what-is-true-belief">What is True Belief?</h3>

<p>I think the definition of true belief is found in John 1:12-13.</p>

<blockquote>
But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, who were born, not of blood nor the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.
</blockquote>

<p>Think back to Jesus’ conversation with Nicodemus.  He talks about being born of the Spirit, and it is a reflection of this passage in John 1.  There is a birth, there is a new beginning in the life of a person who truly believes.</p>

<p>We can say we believe in his name, but unless we are “born… of God” we don’t really believe. Look at the wording above and put it on a mental timeline: those who believe were born of God.  The birth happens in the past tense (“were born”).  Those who were born did receive him, and did believe.</p>

<p>Wow.  I just realized how significant that is.  The spiritual birth makes us believe.  I suppose this is expressed in John 6:44, when Jesus says, “No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him.”  God moves first.  God is the originator of our faith.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>So, there are two ways to believe: first, to see Jesus and logically “believe” in Him, and the second is the belief of one who has been born again.  Although “believe” is used in both situations, they are very, very, different things.</p>
