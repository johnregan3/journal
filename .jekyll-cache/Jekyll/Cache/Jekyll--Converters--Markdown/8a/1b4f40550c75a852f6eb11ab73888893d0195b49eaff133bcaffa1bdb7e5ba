I"é<h2 id="hymn-to-the-word-v-1">Hymn to the Word (v 1)</h2>

<p>The Word.  The Word, the Word, the Word.  This means so much that Iâ€™m having a hard time finding a place to begin.</p>

<p>The Î›ÏŒÎ³Î¿Ï‚.  The purpose. The Hebrew <em>Dabhar</em> (×“Ö¸Ö¼×‘Ö¸×¨), meaning <em>deed</em>, or <em>â€œthat which was accomplished.â€</em>  John is pointing to a concept by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo" target="_blank">Philo</a> that means â€œthe principle of cosmic reasonâ€ (Wikipedia, <em>â€œLogosâ€</em>).</p>

<p>This means that Jesus is this principle, concept of order, this life force, that created and sustains the world.</p>

<p>Jesus is Godâ€™s purpose, his <em>intent</em>.  He is Godâ€™s deed, Godâ€™s action.</p>

<p>Jesus is Godâ€™s message, his statement to the universe.  He is the embodiement of what God wants us to know about himself.</p>

<p>Jesus is Godâ€™s wisdom, his logic.  He is the incarnation of Godâ€™s knowledge and understanding of all things: the nature of God, the nature of man, and the inevitable need for a savior.</p>

<p>I argue that Jesus is the embodiment of the <em>Missio Dei</em>, the combination and culmination of Godâ€™s knowledge &amp; wisdom, His purpose, and His message.  <strong>Jesus is everything that God has for us.</strong></p>

<p>Jesus is God on a mission.  This mission was made flesh and lived among us.</p>

<p>A few plain points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jesus is from Eternity past (pre-existent)</li>
<li>Jesus was with God (co-existent)</li>
<li>Jesus was God (self-existent)</li>
<li>Jesus simultaneously was God and was with God (He is separate from the Father, yet still God)</li>
</ul>

<p>This highlights that although John records that Jesus is Godâ€™s only <em>begotten</em> son, he was not a born or created son.  If Jesus was there from the beginning, he was not part of creation nor a created thing (see Col 1:15).</p>

<p>Also, we see here a reflection of the Trinity, that Jesus was God and was with God simultaneously.  â€œI and the Father are one,â€ Jesus said.</p>

<h2 id="creator-vv-2-3">Creator (vv 2-3)</h2>

<p>Hebrew OT book names are known by their first line.  Genesis is actually called, â€œIn the beginning,â€ and John starts his Gospel in precisely the same way, pointing to the eternality of Jesus, that he was there at the start before the world was made.  â€œAll things were made through him.â€ Nothing that exists exists without being created by him first.  There is no other creator, and nothing was created without his permission, volition, oversight and provision.</p>

<p>This passage cannot be discussed without mentioning Paulâ€™s writing on the preeminence of Christ in <a href="https://www.esv.org/Colossians+1/">Col 1:15-20</a>.  Paul carries on the same themes as John does here.  Jesus is creator, and all things were made through him and also <em>for him</em>.</p>

<h2 id="life-giver-v-4">Life-giver (v 4)</h2>

<p>â€œIn him was lifeâ€ means so much more than merely, â€œhe gave life.â€  He is the source of life, the originator and the fountain it flows from.  There is no life apart from him, and this is both physical and spiritual life.</p>

<h2 id="the-light-of-men-vv-4-5">The Light of Men (vv 4-5)</h2>

<p>This spiritual life was â€œthe light of men,â€ illuminating mankind, giving clarity in the darkness of this world, cutting through our blindness and giving us vision and revealing to us things as they really are.</p>

<p>v4 says life <em>was</em> the light of men in the past tense, however, in v5 it says the light <em>is shining</em> in the darkness, a present ongoing radiance that reaches us still today.</p>

<p>However, the darkness has not (literally) grasped it.  Darkness cannot control nor understand nor overcome this light, this revelation of truth over error, the exposing of evil and sin, this laying-bare of our inner selves.</p>

<p>This word â€œgraspedâ€ (ÎºÎ±Ï„Î­Î»Î±Î²ÎµÎ½) is probably best translated as â€œovercameâ€ or â€œpounced upon.â€  The darkness could not overcome Him.</p>
