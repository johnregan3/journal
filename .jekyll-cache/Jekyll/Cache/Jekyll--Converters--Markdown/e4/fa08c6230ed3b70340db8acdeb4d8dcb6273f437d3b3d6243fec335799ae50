I"i<p>If I’m not careful, life gets really complicated really fast.  Just the noise of following the news can be deafening. Add on top of that personal Bible study, work, family, church, sleep, apps/games, books, and other creative pursuits (like keeping a blog), and it’s easy to feel this latent pressure to fit all of them in, and to do them perfectly.</p>
