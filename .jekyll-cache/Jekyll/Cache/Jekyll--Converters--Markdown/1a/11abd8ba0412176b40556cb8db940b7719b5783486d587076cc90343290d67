<blockquote>No, but because of the disobedience of our first parents, Adam and Eve, all of creation is fallen; we are all born in sin and guilt, corrupt in our nature and unable to keep God's law.<br />(New City Catechism)</blockquote>

<h3 id="able-to-keep-the-law">Able to Keep The Law</h3>

<p>Adam and Eve were created in God‚Äôs image.  When God created them, he said ‚ÄúIt is very good.‚Äù</p>

<h3 id="sin-enters-humanity">Sin Enters Humanity</h3>

<p>When tempted by Satan, Adam and Eve chose to disobey, to declare themselves and their desires higher than God‚Äôs commands.  They believed that real freedom came from living by their own rules.</p>

<p>By this, all of humanity fell.  All of their descendants inherited that corruption (Rom 5:12).  We died (Rom 5:15).  We are slaves to sin (Rom 6:16, 20).</p>

<p>We have all gone astray.  We have all fallen short of the glory of God.</p>

<h3 id="the-role-of-the-law">The Role of The Law</h3>

<p>The Old Testament Law exists for one reason: To show us that we cannot live without sinning.</p>

<blockquote>
"For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowlewdge of sin."<br />(Rom 3:20)
</blockquote>

<h3 id="radically-depraived">Radically Depraived</h3>

<p>Radically comes from the Latin <em>radix</em>, meaning ‚Äúat the core.‚Äù  We are not completely depraived (evil); we are able to do good things, and often do.  However, we are sinful at our core, in our hearts.</p>

<p>This is why children don‚Äôt have to be taught how to lie or hit or be selfish.  It‚Äôs just natural to us.</p>

<h3 id="the-remedy">The Remedy</h3>

<p>We are sinful, and God‚Äôs Law plainly shows us that.  Thankfully, just as death entered through one man, Jesus brings us life (Rom 5:17, 19).</p>

<blockquote>
"...as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through righteousness leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."<br />(Rom 5:21)
</blockquote>

<p>Even though we‚Äôve earned death through our sin, Jesus has bought us eternal life (Rom 6:23).  We are set free from our sin.  The curse has been broken!</p>
