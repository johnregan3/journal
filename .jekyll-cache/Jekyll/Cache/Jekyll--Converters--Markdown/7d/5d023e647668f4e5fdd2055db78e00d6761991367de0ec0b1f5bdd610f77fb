I"ñ<p>One of the major themes in this book is the demand for <strong>Signs</strong>.  People over and again wanted to have a good show, but when Jesus spoke hard things the people left.  A perfect example of this is the entire story around the feeding of the 5,000 (v6:60 ff). <em>See Jn 2:18, 4:48, 6:30, 7:31, etc.</em></p>

<p>Of course, perhaps the largest theme is the Holy Spirit.   People chose to live by the Law, and Jesus (re)introduces them to the Spirit of God (5:39, 7:39)</p>

<p>Another theme is <strong>Godâ€™s Timing</strong>.  Phrases like â€œMy time has not yet come,â€ and â€œthe time is coming and is now here,â€ and â€œThe hourâ€¦â€ are used throughout the book.</p>

<p><strong>About John the Apostle</strong></p>

<p>John was the younger brother of James, the son of Zebedee and Salome.</p>

<p>Although itâ€™s not completely clear, Salome might have been Maryâ€™s sister.  Salome was at the crucifixion (Mark 15:40-41), and the parallell passage in Matthew says â€œthe mother of Zebedeeâ€™s childrenâ€ was there (Mt 27:56).  The kicker is that John describes this woman as Jesusâ€™ â€œmotherâ€™s sisterâ€ in Jn 19:25. Salome also went to the tomb to prepare Jesusâ€™ body when they discovered He was missing (Mark 16:1).</p>

<p>Of course, this would make John Jesusâ€™ cousin (Note that John the Baptist was also most likely a cousin of some kind).  John MacArthur points out that these small communities had a limited pool of people to marry, so there was most likely some interbreeding.</p>
