I"<blockquote>...do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, for you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body. <cite>1 Cor 6:19-20</cite>
</blockquote>

<p>Today I’m thinking about how we care for our bodies.</p>

<p>Americans today are in extremely bad health.  We’re overweight, we smoke or vape, we drink, we don’t sleep.  We do all kinds of things that are bad for our health.</p>

<p>Christians are no exception to this rule.</p>

<p>There is a constant tension in our society over homosexuality, as though it is a special sin.  It definitely falls into what I would say is a certain category of sin, a sin against our own bodies.</p>

<blockquote>"Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body."<cite>1 Cor 6:18</cite></blockquote>

<p>However, <strong>I think many more of us — including Christians — sin against our bodies by not taking care of ourselves</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="a-gift-from-god">A Gift From God</h3>

<p>By simply giving us life, God has given us an immeasurably valuable gift.  Our bodies are a miracle in terms of sheer existence, of course, but also in the way they function.  Every system is fine-tuned so perfectly in order to sustain life.</p>

<h3 id="a-precious-resource">A Precious Resource</h3>

<p>These bodies are vehicles for us to use to praise God and to be the “hands and feet” of Jesus.  They are a tool, a resource that we have been given — just like money — to expand and deepen his kingdom in this world. And, just like the servants given talents to use for their master (Mat 25:14ff), we are given these bodies as a resource to increase what God has given us.</p>

<p>Our bodes are also a tool for praise.  We must “glorify God in [our] bodies.”  This means that we need to make God famous through how we are for ourselves.  How we care for ourselves makes a statement to others about our God.</p>

<h3 id="temple-of-the-holy-spirit">Temple of the Holy Spirit</h3>

<p>Our bodies are where the Holy Spirit is worshipped.  As such, it can be desecrated just as much as it can be sanctified.</p>

<p>And, just like any temple can be defiled by worshipping the wrong gods within it, our bodies can be defiled by what we put in it and do with it.</p>

<h3 id="license">License</h3>

<blockquote>"'Food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food'&mdash;and God will destroy both one and the other."<cite>1 Cor 6:13</cite></blockquote>

<p>In Corinth, people justified their excess by saying, “this is what our bodies were created for,” meaning that we were made to eat, so let’s eat as much as we can.</p>

<p>Paul says that this is blatantly false, and that by misusing our bodies, they can and will be destroyed.</p>

<blockquote>"'All things are lawful for me', but not all things are helpful."</blockquote>

<p>People were using grace as a license for hedonism, as though just because something wasn’t explicitly prohibited, they could do whatever they wanted as much as they wanted.  Paul says that this license is limited by what is <em>beneficial</em>.</p>

<p>Paul gives a qualification to our grace, meaning that we have freedom, as long as what we are doing is good for The Kingdom.</p>

<h3 id="overeating">Overeating</h3>

<p>I believe being overweight is a sin.  Granted, this is not explicitly stated in the Bible, so I don’t hold everyone to it, but as I understand it, it’s damaging to this gift God has given me.</p>

<p>Our bodies were designed with a mechanism to store up energy.  We take advantage of that by eating diets of garbage, empty calories, and throwaway carbs.</p>

<p>And we justify this because these things <em>taste good</em>.  I don’t think this is any different than justifying sexual sin because it feels good.</p>

<p>In Phillipians, Paul speaks of “the enemies of the cross of Christ,” saying:</p>

<blockquote>Their end is destruction, <strong>their god is their belly</strong>, and they glory in their shame, with minds set on earthly things.<cite>Phil 3:19</cite></blockquote>

<p>This statement means that they are ruled by their bodies and physical desires.  To put it another way, <strong>their cravings have become their god.</strong></p>

<h3 id="neglecting-sleep">Neglecting Sleep</h3>

<p>Sleep is as integral to our life as eating, breathing, and reproducing.  All living things sleep.  It is where our bodies repair themselves, and to neglect sleep is to do great harm to ourselves.</p>

<p>In our busy modern lives we work and play much harder than our bodies were designed for.  We <em>require</em> eight hours of sleep a night, but an overwhelming majority of us get less than six.</p>

<p>This is a symptom of our desire for pleasure.  Whether we’re working or playing, we’re filling the short time we have with activities that get us what we want, even if it’s at a crappy job.  We’re working to get ahead in life.  We’re playing and relaxing to try to recharge after all of this work.</p>

<p>The Bible doesn’t mention a requirement to sleep, so once again, I don’t hold anyone else to this, but I believe that this chronic lack of sleep is a sin.  It is abusive to this resource God has given us, and we abuse it for our own sake, not God’s.</p>

<h3 id="alcohol-and-caffeine">Alcohol and Caffeine</h3>

<p>Alcohol and caffeine are not required by out bodies to function, and are by and large harmful substances to our physical bodies.  Of course alcohol isn’t necessarily such, but it most often is.</p>

<p>We put all kinds of substances into our bodies to help us either relax or work harder.  Caffeine is another example of this.</p>

<p>In moderation, these are often not harmful, but very, very easily they can be.  We must be careful with how we use them so they will not damage this gift God has given us.</p>

<h3 id="nicotine-and-drugs">Nicotine and Drugs</h3>

<p>Nicotine and drugs are used to help us escape, to calm us down or help ease our minds.  They cool our anxiety, but they are damaging to our bodies.</p>

<h3 id="escaping-idolatry">Escaping Idolatry</h3>

<p>By letting our minds and bodies rule us, we place them on the throne of our lives and worship them in the place of God.</p>

<p>It’s important to remember that just like any other sin, sheer willpower will not deliver us from the sin of trashing out bodies, only turning to Jesus to be our savior.</p>

<p><strong>We must remember that we are not our own.  We were bought with a price, and that price was the life of Jesus.</strong></p>
