I"è<h3 id="the-word-became-flesh">The Word Became Flesh</h3>

<p>The Message, the Mission of God (The Word) became human.  Flesh (ÏƒÎ¬ÏÎ¾) is used for â€œmeatâ€ (of an animal), â€œthe bodyâ€, and â€œhuman nature.â€  It <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?t=kjv&amp;strongs=g4561">comes from an older word</a> that gives ÏƒÎ¬ÏÎ¾ the denotation of â€œthat which is stripped off of the bone,â€ or â€œthat which is stripped of skin.â€  See also John 1:13.</p>

<p>God took on human form.  The author of the story became a character in the story.  To use Tim Kellerâ€™s metaphor, itâ€™s as though Shakespear entered his own play.</p>

<h3 id="the-word-dwelt-among-us">The Word Dwelt Among Us</h3>

<p>God literally <em>tabernacled</em> among us.  He pitched his tent in our camp.  He set up residence and established a life here.</p>

<h3 id="we-have-seen-his-glory">We Have Seen His Glory</h3>

<p>We (meaning the apostles? humanity?) have seen (Î¸ÎµÎ¬Î¿Î¼Î±Î¹: studied, perceived with the eyes) his glory.</p>

<p>The glory is splendor, majesty, and brightness (as in the sun).  When we saw Jesus, our eyes were upon Godâ€™s radiance.</p>

<p>This is directly connected with v. 18 (see below)</p>

<h3 id="the-glory-only-a-son-can-reveal">The Glory Only a Son can Reveal</h3>

<p>â€œâ€¦glory as of the only son from the father.â€ Jesus showed us the radiance of God.  Itâ€™s something only the very son could reveal about his father.</p>

<p>And, this glory is full of grace and truth.  Generosity.  Reality.  Jesus reveals Godâ€™s generosity paired the reality of God.</p>

<p>Note that Jesus didnâ€™t reveal Godâ€™s judgement upon mankind, but Godâ€™s generosity.</p>

<h3 id="more-clarification-about-john-the-baptist">More Clarification About John the Baptist</h3>

<p>Parenthetically, John further clarifies that John the Baptist was pointing the way to Jesus, the one â€œwho ranks beforeâ€ him.  John the Baptist was not the light, but came to bear witness about the light (v 7)</p>

<h3 id="grace-upon-grace">Grace Upon Grace</h3>

<p>â€œFrom his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace.â€</p>

<p>In the ESV, this sentence is a bit confusing.  It sounds like the comma shouldnâ€™t be there.  The KJV is a bit more clear, showing that we have received two things from Jesus: 1. Godâ€™s fullness, and 2. grace (upon grace).</p>

<p>We receive (Î»Î±Î¼Î²Î¬Î½Ï‰) Godâ€™s fullness (Ï€Î»Î·ÏÏŒÏ‰).  In Jesus we get the full presence of God.  Heâ€™s the whole package.  We can look at Jesus and see who God is.  Î»Î±Î¼Î²Î¬Î½Ï‰ implies that we take hold of the abundance, the â€œfilling-nessâ€ of God.</p>

<p>Grace upon grace.  Literally â€œÏ‡Î¬ÏÎ¹Î½ á¼€Î½Ï„á½¶ Ï‡Î¬ÏÎ¹Ï„Î¿Ï‚.â€  Ï‡Î¬ÏÎ¹Î½ is a direct object of the verb.  Ï‡Î¬ÏÎ¹Ï„Î¿Ï‚ is the genetive, which is coupled with á¼€Î½Ï„á½¶.  á¼€Î½Ï„á½¶ means â€œbeforeâ€, â€œover againstâ€, or â€œinstead of.â€   Typically it means â€œinstead ofâ€, but can rarely mean â€œin addition to.â€  Also, â€œexchangeâ€ or â€œsuccession.â€  Because â€œgrace instead of graceâ€ doesnâ€™t really mean anything, I think John is saying â€œgrace added to graceâ€ or â€œgrace piled upon graceâ€ or â€œgrace multiplied.â€</p>

<p>All of this points back to v 14, that from Jesus we see Godâ€™s glory full of grace and truth.  This generosity from God is heaped upon us in Jesus.  <strong>Jesus taking on flesh really is Godâ€™s greatest gift to humanity.</strong></p>

<h3 id="law-vs-grace">Law vs. Grace</h3>

<p>Moses brought The Law, and Jesus brought Grace and Truth.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s fascinating that John has now coupled Grace and Truth together twice.  Is this a jab at gnositicism?  Iâ€™m not sure.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s important to note that itâ€™s not Satan who chases us toward Hell, but Moses.  Itâ€™s â€œhisâ€ law that convicts us of sin, and that sin can only bring death, while Jesus brings Godâ€™s grace and mercy.</p>

<h3 id="jesus-made-god-known">Jesus Made God Known</h3>

<p>No one has ever seen God, but Jesus has made him known (v 18)</p>

<p>Note that in 17 Moses is specifically mentioned, the person who saw Godâ€™s back, yet in v. 18 John still says, â€œno one has ever seen God.â€</p>

<p>John also repeats this sentiment in 1 John 4:11-12: â€œBeloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.  No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us.â€</p>

<p>Why did John stick this phrase in the middle of a passage about loving one another?</p>

<p>â€œthe only God, who is at the Fatherâ€™s side, he has made him known.â€  â€œâ€¦the only Godâ€ is literally â€œthe only begotten son, which is in the bosom of the father.â€ [Î¼Î¿Î½Î¿Î³ÎµÎ½á½´Ï‚ Î¸Îµá½¸Ï‚ á½ á½¢Î½ Îµá¼°Ï‚ Ï„á½¸Î½ ÎºÏŒÎ»Ï€Î¿Î½ Ï„Î¿á¿¦ Ï€Î±Ï„Ïá½¸Ï‚]</p>

<p>Did God make Jesus (the God at the Fatherâ€™s side) known, or did Jesus make the Father known? â€œmake knownâ€ (á¼Î¾Î·Î³Î®ÏƒÎ±Ï„Î¿) is an Aorist  Indicitive Middle Deponent â€“ basically an active action but upon the subject itself.  â€œHe has declared himselfâ€?  I really canâ€™t tell.</p>
