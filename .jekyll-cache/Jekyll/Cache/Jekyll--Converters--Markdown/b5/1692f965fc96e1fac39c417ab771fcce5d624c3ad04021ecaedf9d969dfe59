<p>Initial Notes:
Listened to “The Naked Bible Podcast,” episode 95 with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-burnett-8a598675/">David Burnett</a>, entitled “<a href="https://drmsh.com/naked-bible-95-david-burnett-resurrection-and-the-death-of-the-gods/">Resurrection and Death of the Gods</a>.”</p>

<p>The list of beings here matches the list used by Moses in Deuteronomy 4:15-19.</p>

<p>The gist of it (and will require more personal research), is that the “celestial” beings mentioned in the lists (sun, moon, etc.) are connected to the “rulers and principalities” mentioned by Paul.  They are other “gods” of this world, including Greek gods and all that mess.</p>

<p>Burnett seemed to be getting at the idea that there is more to these “rulers and prinicipalities” than we modern Westerners catch.  The number 70 comes up a bunch: when Moses annointed 70 elders and they met with God (Numbers 11:16-25)</p>

<p>It also included discussion to (the related) Psalm 89:5-7, on the “holy ones” and the strength of this term, as well as how translating “holy ones” as saints strips the term of its power and meaning.</p>

<p>Burnett’s relevant paper is <em>A Neglected Deuteronomic Scriptural Matrix for the Nature of the Resurrection Body in 1 Cor 15:39-42</em></p>
