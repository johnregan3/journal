<p>This week our Associate Pastor resigned, confessing that he’s been having a sexual relationship with an adult youth group volunteer.  They are both married.  He has four kids.  He was an Elder, part of our church’s (formerly) four-man leadership team.</p>

<p><em>Before I go any further, note that although there are two people involved in this situation, I’m directly speaking to how we handled the man’s part of the responsibility.  This focus is not to diminish the woman’s responsibility or accountability, nor is it to imply that we haven’t spent just as much care and heartache in handling her situation as well.</em></p>

<p>We are all devistated.  These two people we love have broken our trust, deceiving us for over a year now.  We feel cheated, foolish, and used.</p>

<p>The hard part about dealing with this situation is that we Elders have had to deal with this man on three different levels: 1.) as an Employee, 2.) as a fellow Elder, and 3.) as a member under our care.</p>

<h3 id="as-an-employee">As an Employee</h3>

<p>The decision on how to deal with this situation with an employee of the church was made simple by this man’s resignation.  However, it should be assumed that he would have been fired immediately, because, as an employer in the least-spiritual sense of the word, we can’t have this going on in our workplace.  This is an issue of integrity and ethics, and this wouldn’t fly in any other workplace.</p>

<h3 id="as-a-fellow-elder">As a Fellow Elder</h3>

<p>This was an emotionally hard hill to climb.  He’s been an integral part of our team: not just because of his administrative and organizational skills, but because we value his insight in decisionmaking.  He genuinely loves Jesus and loves His Church.  He always has, and I will never doubt that.</p>

<p>However, this man’s actions have hurt our people’s trust in their Elders.  You see, we understand this role as that of shepherds: we lead, guide and protect.  We will give an account for our people before Jesus someday, and we’ll be judged more harshly because of the responsibilty that we’ve been entrusted with.  Yet here we are, facing our community with the news that one of us was far from the man of integrity that they trusted us to be.  Futhermore, the rest of us failed to protect them from the results of this.  I’m not sure if this affair was truly preventable, but there were warning signs that we didn’t heed just because this man is a “good guy.”</p>

<p>There were red flags.  When our Senior Pastor called the meeting, us other Elders already knew what it was about. We knew the two of them were good friends, often joking around together and leading youth trips with no other adults along for the ride.  He always passionately defended this volunteer when we had to discuss a couple of issues regarding the woman’s spiritual maturity.  What we didn’t know was the phone calls they had, and we didn’t know that they were meeting alone.</p>

<p>As with his position as an employee, he was removed as an Elder without any need for discussion.</p>

<h3 id="as-a-church-member">As a Church Member</h3>

<p>This issue is much more nuanced than the others.  Where it was obvious what needed to be done with him as an employee and Elder, our approach to dealing with his sin in this case required some discussion. One of us had been his best friend since college – over 20 years, and me and my family have known them for years, with our wives and kids being best friends.  All three of us remaining Elders have teens in the youth group that this man led.</p>

<p>This man is our brother.  He’s walked with us through some tremendous issues in our lives.  He’s been a mentor and friend to our sons.</p>

<h3 id="how-we-faced-our-community">How We Faced Our Community</h3>

<p>The staff member resigned/confessed on a Monday evening.  The remainging elders stayed for an initial discussion/debrief.  During this discussion we decided that we needed to notify our congregation with as much information as possible as soon as possible.  We did this for two reasons: to avoid even the appearance of a cover-up, and also to prevent bad information from being spread.  What we discovered later was this early meeting would allow us to set the tone for the congregation: one of grief over anger, and restoration over shunning.  We decided that pre-empting our regular Wednesday night activities would be our best option, as it was a time when the core members of our church were already in the building, plus it was soon enough that we could head off any rumors.</p>

<p>On Tuesday night we Elders met along with our wives to further refine our message, as well as assign roles for Wednesday night (since our Associate Pastor also led the Youth Ministry).  My wife and I volunteered to tell the Youth while the other two elders would explain the situation to the adults.  Children would not be told anything so that their parents could use their judgment in how to explain this to their kids.</p>

<p>We also assigned jobs to personally notifying church leaders (official or otherwise).  In addition to notifying our volunteer childrens’ minister, we also reached out our other adult youth volunteer, and some senior adults that serve as anchors and influencers to our congregation.  These people were either involved in the events of the coming Wednesday or were people who might need to ask detailed questions in private about what happened to better support the congregation through this.  Additionally, this showed these people some respect, that we would trust them with this news in advance of everyone else.</p>

<p>So, Wendesday night, literally 48 hours after we ourselves got the news, we met with the church.  The other two Elders met with the adults, while me, my wife, and an adult volunteer met with the teenagers. (Naturally, I can only share details about my own experience that night)</p>

<p>[It was like funeral for the students taht knew. Hugging, hushed tones]</p>

<p>I began by telling the teens that tonight we were going to find out how big they believed Jesus is.  I also led by telling them that I had bad news for them.  With this in mind, I didn’t make them wait long anticipating what the bad news would be.  I did, however, take a moment to explain who I was (for those I didn’t know), as well as our role as Elders.  I said we were shepherds, that we lead, guide, and protect the people.</p>

<p>Then I just said it: “David resigned Monday night.  He and Rebecca have been having a sexual affair.”  It was hard, but I wanted to be as direct as possible so there was no misunderstanding about what had been going on.  Also, avoiding ambiguity showed them respect as young adults.</p>

<p>I had a direction in which I wanted to take the meeting, but it required them some time to process the news.  So, I told a story from my own experience about this that might be helpful to those still listening and would also allow others to let the news soak in.</p>

<p>You see, I have been through a similar experience as a teenager.  My wife and I had a youth pastor that moved on to a new position in our city, and within a year he left his wife and two boys for (literally) the new church’s organ player.  In our case, when the teens heard the news, they all scattered.  I know of a woman who will still have nothing to do with Christianity even 25 years later.</p>

<p>I don’t want this for our teens, especially my own kids.</p>

<p>I told them it was okay to feel whatever they were feeling, even anger.  I told them anger isn’t sinful in and of itself, but it can become sinful.  Also that it feels safe – you feel protected and strong, but it’s corrosive, and bitterness will overwhelm and destroy you.</p>

<p>Finally, I passed around paper and let them write anonymous questions on them.  After they passed them in, I answered them.</p>

<p>One was, “How could they do this to us?”  I said that no one ever wakes up one morning and says, “I think I’m going to destroy my life and all of those around me.”  It’s much more gradual than that.  I told them an abbreviated version of what the Youth Minister told us: it started as phone calls about the ministry, that turned into theological discussions, that led to discussions about their personal lives, that eventually ran out of their control.  Its a slow decline down, not a fast fall.</p>

<p>Someone asked how soon they could talk to the spouses and kids involved.  I was getting ready to respond when an adult volunteer spoke up,  She said that she had a miscarriage a few years ago, and that initially people didn’t know what to say, so at best they told her the “If you need anything, just let us know” kind of thing.  She said that before long, she was all alone and felt forgotten.  Even if they didn’t know what to say to her, she just wanted someone to listen, or even to say they were thinking about her.  She said that the teens should reach out as soon as they want, and if they are told that they don’t want to talk, then back off.  Even if they’re not ready to open up, it’s at least nice to know that someone is thinking of them.</p>

<p>Finally, they asked, “How soon can we show them love?” referring to the youth pastor and the volunteer.  That was a tearjerker.  Of course, I said, “Right now.”</p>

<p>It turns out the meeting with the adults went better than we anticipated.  People were hurt and angry, but they kept their heads. They expressed that they wanted to get involved to help fill in the gaps that the associate pastor filled, as well as that they wanted to reach out to the people involved for healing and restoration.</p>

<p>It was an incredible night.  Afterward several of the teens (including my own kids) told me that it went the best that it could have. I know the teens actually left inspired.  They wanted to take ownership of the youth group, to go to work doing ministry to one another and to the rest of the church.</p>

<h3 id="interacting-with-the-families-involved">Interacting with the Families Involved</h3>

<p>As part of the youth’s  ministry to others, my boys coordinated with a friend to go to by groceries for the former associate pastor’s family, as they are close friends.d  We met with another young man at the grocery store on Saturday morning and went shopping.  They spent their own money to buy fun snacks and candy and chocolate milk and unicorn mac ‘n cheese and Monsters.  We delivered it to the man’s family and spent a while talking with his wife about her situation.</p>

<p>Of course, she is devistated, completely broken and humiliated.  She’d been fooled, and that realization hurt.  Of course, no one holds her responsible for what her husband did (and she knows that!), yet she still feels embarassed.</p>

<p>Her strongest emotion at the time was anger, and I think that makes a lot of sense.  She’s said repeatedly that he doesn’t really understand the magnitude of what he’s done.</p>
