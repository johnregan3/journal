## Did God Create Us Unable to Keep His Law?

<blockquote>No, but because of the disobedience of our first parents, Adam and Eve, all of creation is fallen; we are all born in sin and guilt, corrupt in our nature and unable to keep God's law.<br />(New City Catechism)</blockquote>

### Able to Keep The Law

Adam and Eve were created in God's image.  When God created them, he said "It is very good."

### Sin Enters Humanity

When tempted by Satan, Adam and Eve chose to disobey, to declare themselves and their desires higher than God's commands.  They believed that real freedom came from living by their own rules.

By this, all of humanity fell.  All of their descendants inherited that corruption (Rom 5:12).  We died (Rom 5:15).  We are slaves to sin (Rom 6:16, 20).

We have all gone astray.  We have all fallen short of the glory of God.

### The Role of The Law

The Old Testament Law exists for one reason: To show us that we cannot live without sinning.

<blockquote>
"For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowlewdge of sin."<br />(Rom 3:20)
</blockquote>

### Radically Depraived

Radically comes from the Latin _radix_, meaning "at the core."  We are not completely depraived (evil); we are able to do good things, and often do.  However, we are sinful at our core, in our hearts.

This is why children don't have to be taught how to lie or hit or be selfish.  It's just natural to us.

### The Remedy

We are sinful, and God's Law plainly shows us that.  Thankfully, just as death entered through one man, Jesus brings us life (Rom 5:17, 19).

<blockquote>
"...as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through righteousness leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."<br />(Rom 5:21)
</blockquote>

Even though we've earned death through our sin, Jesus has bought us eternal life (Rom 6:23).  We are set free from our sin.  The curse has been broken!
