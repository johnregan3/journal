If I'm not careful, life gets really complicated really fast.  Just the noise of following the news can be deafening. Add on top of that personal Bible study, work, family, church, sleep, apps/games, books, and other creative pursuits (like keeping a blog), and it's easy to feel this latent pressure to fit all of them in, and to do them perfectly.

Periodically, I have to do a "reset," meaning I have to assess the things I'm working on and throw out what's not important.

Of course, what matters most are the roles/activities that have eternal significance:

1. Jesus (personal)
2. Family
3. Church (corporate)

And then physical health:

1. Sleep
2. Exercise (which I don't presently do)

Taking care of my family:

1. Work
2. Time

Education/Learning:

1. Bible Study
2. Reading Books

Converting this into hours:

<table class="table">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Sleep</td>
<td>56</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Exercise</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Work</td>
<td>40</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Commute</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bible Study</td>
<td>7</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Church</td>
<td>5+</td>
</tr>
<tfoot>
</tfoot>
<tr>
<td><strong>Total</strong></td>
<td><strong>118 / 168</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

So those set times (including that pesky excercise I have yet to start) come out to about 70% of my week.

Unfortunately, about 10-15 hours are wasted between the time I wake up at 4AM and start doing anything meaningful, like my Bible study.

The remaining 40-50 hours are for family and family activities, like practices.  They also include regular activities like eating and doing chores.
