## A Witness

John the Baptist was sent from God.  Note the word "from" and not "by."

John the Baptist came as a witness.  He came to give testimony, an affidavit, about the Light.  He came to tell us what he knew about Jesus, this Light that "shines in the darkness" and that darkness has not overcome.

He witnessed so that "all might believe through him."  This was the purpose in his mission.

## Not the Light

John was not the light.  He only came to bear witness about the Light.

Why was this clarification needed?  Because there was confusion amog the people (see 1:19-23).

I wonder if there was also confusion about this during the time of John (the Apostle).
