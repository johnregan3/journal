One of the major themes in this book is the demand for **Signs**.  People over and again wanted to have a good show, but when Jesus spoke hard things the people left.  A perfect example of this is the entire story around the feeding of the 5,000 (v6:60 ff). _See Jn 2:18, 4:48, 6:30, 7:31, etc._

Of course, perhaps the largest theme is the Holy Spirit.   People chose to live by the Law, and Jesus (re)introduces them to the Spirit of God (5:39, 7:39)

Another theme is **God's Timing**.  Phrases like "My time has not yet come," and "the time is coming and is now here," and "The hour..." are used throughout the book.

**About John the Apostle**

John was the younger brother of James, the son of Zebedee and Salome.

Although it's not completely clear, Salome might have been Mary's sister.  Salome was at the crucifixion (Mark 15:40-41), and the parallell passage in Matthew says "the mother of Zebedee's children" was there (Mt 27:56).  The kicker is that John describes this woman as Jesus' "mother's sister" in Jn 19:25. Salome also went to the tomb to prepare Jesus' body when they discovered He was missing (Mark 16:1).

Of course, this would make John Jesus' cousin (Note that John the Baptist was also most likely a cousin of some kind).  John MacArthur points out that these small communities had a limited pool of people to marry, so there was most likely some interbreeding.
