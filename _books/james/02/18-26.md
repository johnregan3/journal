Last night I realized there is something funny going on here.  It started with v. 24:

<em>"You see that a person is justified by works **and not by faith alone**."</em>

Wow. According to James it's not faith alone.

His justification comes just beforehand as he uses Moses as an example of how Works work alongside Faith to save us.  He speaks of how Moses offered Isaac on the altar, and God credited his belief to him as rightousness.

However, James is incorrect here.  The quote, "Abraham belived God, and it was counted to him as righteousness," is not found after the near-sacrifice of Isaac (Gen 22).  It's acutally found much earlier in the story, when God promises Moses a son (Gen 15:6).

So I think James' interpretation of the life of Moses (and therefore his argument that works combine with faith to save us) is incorrect.

Am I allowed to disagree with a biblical author?  If we allow scripture to interpret scripture, and the clear passages to have precedence over the unclear ones, I think I can in this case.

Does this mean that the entire book of James is wrong?  No. A person can be wrong (or mistaken) about one point and that doesn't invalidate everything else they ever said.
